ADR-004: Enforce Role-Based Access Control and Tenant Isolation at the API Layer

Status: Proposed
Date: 01-08-26

Context
The system supports multiple user types (consumer, agent, support, manager, admin) and is intended to support multiple organisations. Preventing unauthorised actions and cross-tenant data access is a core requirement.

Decision
The system will apply RBAC and tenant scoping centrally in the API layer:

Each request will carry an authenticated user identity and role claims

Requests will be scoped to a tenant context (e.g., tenant header/claim)

Data access will always filter by tenant

Consequences

Positive: Consistent enforcement across all clients; reduces risk of accidental cross-tenant access; easier to audit.

Negative: Additional implementation complexity; requires disciplined testing around permissions and tenant filtering.
