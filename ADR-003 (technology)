ADR-003: Use a Relational Database with Audit Logging

Status: Proposed
Date: 01-08-26

Context
Complaints, users, assignments, and reporting data have strong relationships and require reliable consistency. The system also needs traceability for changes (who changed what and when).

Decision
The system will use a relational database for primary data storage and will include an audit log to record key actions (e.g., status updates, assignment changes, resolution confirmation).

Consequences

Positive: Strong consistency and query capability; supports reporting and SLA calculations; audit trail improves accountability.

Negative: Schema changes require migrations; audit logging increases storage volume and must be managed.
