ADR-002: Use REST/JSON for Service Communication

Status: Proposed
Date: 01-08-26

Context
Multiple clients (web, mobile, agent console) are expected, and the system should be easy to integrate with external services such as notifications and future channels.

Decision
The application layer will expose functionality through RESTful endpoints using JSON over HTTPS.

Consequences

Positive: Broad client compatibility; straightforward testing (Postman/Swagger); clear separation between client and server.

Negative: Requires careful endpoint consistency and error handling; may need pagination and filtering patterns early to avoid later breaking changes.
