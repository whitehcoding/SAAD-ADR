ADR-001: Implement a Three-Level Structure

Status: Suggested
Date: 01-08-2026

Context
To facilitate maintainability, testing, and future expansion, the system's user-facing interfaces, business logic, and data storage must be clearly separated.

Decision
The solution will use a three-tier architecture consisting of:

Presentation layer (agent UI, mobile, and online)

Application layer (business rules and REST APIs)

Relational database, or data layer

Consequences

Positive: Supports API reuse (e.g., chatbot later); makes it easy to develop the UI and backend independently; clearly separates responsibilities.

Negative: Requires careful API design and versioning; adds integration overhead between levels.
